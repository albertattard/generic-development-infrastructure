# Create compute instance with different Oracle Java and different Oracle GraalVM

Create compute instance with different Oracle Java and different Oracle GraalVM.

## Prerequisites

- Oracle OCI account

  Create an [OCI account](https://cloud.oracle.com/) and create/download an
  API key

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## Set up

1. Create an SSH key pair, that will be used to authenticate/log-in the
   instance.

   This example assumes that the private key is found at
   `~/.ssh/ssh-key-oci-instance.key`.

2. Create the `./terraform/terraform.tfvars` file and provide a value to each
   variable. Following is a sample.

   ```terraform
   name_prefix                = "Java Development Environment"
   dns_label                  = "jde"
   instance_vnic_display_name = "dev"
   region         = "us-ashburn-1"
   tenancy_id     = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   freeform_tags = {
   }
   defined_tags = {
   }
   ssh_authorized_keys = [
   ]
   ssh_private_key_file = "~/.ssh/ssh-key-oci-instance.key"
   image_source_id      = "ocid1.image.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaakp5agw5rxfiq6nede7ousfcdfuflfjgsu7bstmnx737ah4ylmu6q"
   ```

3. Download the following Linux x86 (`taz.gz`) binaries and save them in the
   [`./oci/terraform/binaries`](./oci/terraform/binaries) directory.

   **Please do not include these binaries in the repository**.

   Don't forget to update the
   [`./terraform/binaries/checksums.txt`](./terraform/binaries/checksums.txt)
   file with the correct sha256 checksum.

4. Deploy the infrastructure

   Run the [`deploy`](./deploy) script from within this directory.

   ```shell
   $ ./deploy
   ```

   This will take about 30 minutes as it needs to upload all the binaries and
   then install them and will create several resources including an OCI instance
   with different versions of Java installed.

   Once ready, it will print the public IP address of this instance and a
   command that can be used to ssh into this machine.

   ```
   ...
   instance_public_ip = "###.###.###.###"
   ssh_command = "ssh -i ~/.ssh/ssh-key-oci-instance.key opc@###.###.###.###"
   ```

5. (_Optionally_) Verify that it is working.

   ```shell
   $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/ssh-key-oci-instance.key \
     "opc@$(terraform -chdir='./terraform' output -json | jq --raw-output '.instance_public_ip.value')"
   ```

   There is an alias for each JDK version that helps you to switch to this JDK
   quickly. Switch to JDK17 using the `java17` alias and verify the Java
   version.

   ```shell
   > java17
   > java --version
   ...
   ```

## Tear down

When ready, destroy the infrastructure so that you don't incur unnecessarily
charges, by running the `destroy` script from within the `./oci` directory.

```shell
$ ./destroy
```

This will destroy all resources that were created by the same terraform script.
